# WWEstats - Match Durations 2019 - May 10th 2022

A small web-scraping script for data collection from profightdb.com with the Python libraries Requests and BeaautifulSoup4.

____________________________
As a WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) Fan I as curious about how much the actual duration of each weekly tv show wrestling match 
may have changed from the pre-pandemic to the (more or less) post-pandemic days. Therefore, the script crawles the profightdb.com html tables, 
beginning in the year 2019 to today (last TV show on May 10th 2022), and eventually transforms and transferes the data into a locally saved SQLite database.

Further (interactive) data analysis will be done with Tableau.
